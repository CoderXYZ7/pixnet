# PIXNET Server Requirements
# 
# This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the PIXNET server.
# The server is designed to use only Python standard library modules to minimize
# dependencies and ensure easy deployment.

# No external dependencies required!
# The PIXNET server implementation uses only Python standard library modules:
#
# - socket: TCP network communication
# - struct: Binary data packing/unpacking
# - threading: Multi-client support
# - time: Timestamps and timing
# - zlib: Data compression (imported but not yet used)
# - secrets: Cryptographically secure session ID generation
# - argparse: Command-line argument parsing

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:
# (Uncomment if you want to add these features)
